type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This instruction assumes you have working GitHub and Travis accounts. If not see [1, 2].

# Create a new repository in GitHub
# Create a Personal access token in GitHub (https://github.com/settings/tokens) with enabling the access for `repo`, and `gist`. 
# Save the token from step two above somewhere as you can use it in the below steps
# Go to https://travis-ci.com/ and sign-in
# Select the repository you want to use with Travis CI
# On the Travis setting for selected repository (`https://travis-ci.org/<your-github-username>/<your-selected-repo>/settings`) create an environmental variable with
#* ''name''=`GITHUB_TOKEN` and 
#* ''value''=`the token generated in step 2 above` (like `553dca4a315eb43dd259948db7b9ae18be2d2bd5`)
#* Make sure to mark "Display value in build log" as "Off".
# In order for Travis CI to build your project, you'll need to add a `.travis.yml` configuration file to the root directory of your repository. (see [[Travis Configuration File]])
# After completing these steps, Travis-CI will use the YAML configuration file and generate wiki from indivisual tiddlers in your root directory of your repository.
# You can see what is going on in Travis-CI, repository, ''Build History'' and ''Current'' tabs.
# This will create an `index.html` in your GitHub repositort page under new branch `gh-pages`
# To give public access to the created `index.html` you can setup GitHub Pages from setting page of your repository. To do this
#* Goto GitHUb and open the repository and then go to Setting page
#* In Options tab, find GitHub Pages and for Source use `gh-pages` branch
#* Point to the new webpage GitHub generates under GitHub Pages!
# That's all
